# Introduction
Code implement for _Interpretable machine learning based terrorist attack success rate prediction_.
The entire project is divided into two parts, the data process and XAI.
# Data process
Due to Dataset restrictions (see https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/terms-of-use/), the authors cannot open source the terrorist attack data here.

If anyone wants to reproduce the dataset, please download the latest GTD "globalterrorismdb_0522dist.xlsx" (see https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/),WGI (see https://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/) and ICRG(see https://www.prsgroup.com/explore-our-products/icrg/) and put them in the "/" fold.
and run the data_process.py, you will get the whole dataset.
# XAI part
Run XAI.py and you will get the result of ml models and importance analysis.
